## Day 1
Today was a great day. I stole from this little girl. It was a lego set and I sure do __*love*__ lego! Also, she didnt even leave out cookies and milk for Santa, so like, Im doing him a favour.

I build the lego set by the way, it was *okay* at best.
## Day 2
Today I stole a nerf gun from this rude boy. He yelled at me to get out of his house so then I threw rocks at his window, and I got a nerf gun out of it so who cares.
